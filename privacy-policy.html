            <p>This Privacy Policy was last revised on 20 January 2021.</p>
            <ol>

              <li><u>Introduction.</u></li>

              <p>This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes how Voya Health, Inc. (“Voya Health”) collectively referred to as “we,” “our,” and “us” in this Privacy Policy, collect and use personal information from and about you when you use the Voya Health website <a href="https://www.voyahealth.com" class="nanotek-link">[https://www.voyahealth.com]</a> and mobile application(s) (collectively, the “Website”), and/or when you communicate with Voya Health by e-mail, text message, telephone conversation, chat, or other means of communicating electronically or by voice or video. Though the Website, we make certain information available to you regarding in-person and remote musculoskeletal care and facilitates your access to telemedicine and expert medical services (the “Services”) provided by Voya Health Medical Group, PLLC (the “PLLC”). Voya Health understands that privacy of information is of great importance to our Visitors.</p>
              
              <li><u>This Privacy Policy Applies to the Following Types of Information:</u></li>  
              
              <p>The Information we may collect, includes without limitation:</p>  
              
              <p>Information that identifies you or can be used to identify you, such as your name; home or work address; personal or work e-mail address; home, work, and mobile telephone numbers; date of birth; credit or debit card numbers (which we collect for payment purposes only); images and videos; age, sex, and gender; Social Security Number; physical or mental health condition or history; health plan or insurance information; and other personal information;</p>
              
              <p>Information that you provide to be published or displayed (“posted”) on certain public areas of the Website or that you transmit through the Website to other users of the Website;</p>
              
              <p>Information about your Internet use or connection; the equipment you use to visit our Website; usage details, such as traffic data, logs, referring/exit pages, the date and time of your visit to our Website; error information; clickstream data; and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on our Website, including without limitation usage details, IP addresses, and information collected through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies; and Information provided to us by others, such as our business partners.</p>
              
              <p><i>Personal Information</i></p>
              
              <p>We collect information that personally identifies you, such as your name, telephone number, email address, date of birth, data generated by sensors in the devices you use to access the Services and other data which can be reasonably linked to such information (“Personal Information”) only if you choose to share such information with us. For example, you will be required to provide us with certain Personal Information to register for the Services, sign up for certain features available through the Services (such as push notifications, text messages and other communications services which may offer you the ability to share information with third parties, such as health care professionals), and at other times. The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you decide not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Services. Further, Voya Health may offer location-enabled services, for example to locate a nearby doctor or pharmacy. If you use those services, Voya Health may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). You will have the option to disable collection and use of location information. However, doing so may prevent you from using some features of the Services, or limit the function of some features.</p>
              
              <p><i>Health Information</i></p>
              
              <p>Voya Health offers you the ability to share your Health Information with the PLLC in connection with the Services. “Health Information” includes both Protected Health Information and Additional Health Information. “Protected Health Information” or “PHI” is personally identifiable information which relates to your health or payment for your healthcare services that is created or received by an entity covered under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and its implementing regulations (“HIPAA”), such as Voya Health as a business associate of the PLLC, and the PLLC, as a covered entity under HIPAA. Protected Health Information includes the combination of your Personal Information and personal health information, such as medical records, medical history and/or information regarding a condition or treatment (e.g. information about symptoms, prescriptions, allergies, diagnoses and outcomes or side effects of treatment). “Additional Health Information” is any and all other personal health information that is not Protected Health Information, generally because such information was not created or received by a HIPAA-covered entity.</p>
              
              <p>When you use the Services, you expressly authorize the sharing of your Health Information with anyone whom is part of your Services team and is also a user of the Services, which may include your healthcare professional(s).</p>
              
              <p>If you allow someone to access your account, you do so at your sole risk and may risk exposing your Health Information. Voya Health does not know and cannot control how anyone else to whom you give access to your account and/or with whom you share your Health Information may use your Health Information or account. Health Information you provide to others may not be protected, kept private, or be secure. You are solely responsible for all use of your account, by yourself or anyone whom you permit to use it. Voya Health will not be liable for any disclosure or use of Health Information or other information by you or anyone using your account with your permission.</p>
              
              <p>You should not upload any Health Information regarding any person other than yourself without that person’s prior express consent. You must obtain the consent of your family member or any other person before you submit or share Health Information about that person. By submitting or sharing Health Information about a family member or anyone else, you represent and warrant that you have obtained that person’s express consent to do so or that you otherwise have the legal authority to do so (e.g., because that person is a minor and you are the parent or legal guardian).</p>
              
              <p>This Privacy Policy also applies to information collected from Visitors after they register and log-in ("Members") to the password protected and secure portions of our website and mobile application ("Secure Platforms"). These Secure Platforms allow Members to utilize the Services provided by the PLLC.</p>
              
              <p>This Privacy Policy details how we may use, share and maintain any information that you provide to us or to the PLLC. Voya Health's role is limited to making such information available to you and/or facilitate your access to the Services, on behalf of the PLLC as its “business associate” as that term is defined under HIPAA. Voya Health is independent from the PLLC and the healthcare providers that may provide you with Services through the PLLC. Voya Health is not responsible for the PLLC’s acts, omissions or for any content of the communications made by them to you. Voya Health does not engage in the practice of medicine or provide any health services to you. Voya Health provides certain business associate services to the PLLC.</p>
              
              <p>Any Health Information stored and collected by Voya Health or added by Members into such Secure Platforms is identifiable, PHI and therefore governed by HIPAA. How the PLLC uses and discloses such PHI shall be in accordance with the PLLC’s Notice of Privacy Practices. For example, if you have consented to importing data from your healthcare provider into the Secure Platform, you should review the PLLC’s Notice of Privacy Practices to understand how the PLLC will use and disclose such PHI.</p>
              
              <li><u>Agreement to this Privacy Policy</u></li> 
              
              <p>Your access and use of the Website and Secure Platforms are subject to your agreement with this Privacy Policy and the Website Terms of Use. By using the Website, you expressly agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and consent to the collection and use of information as discussed in this Privacy Policy.</p>
              
              <p>If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use or access the Website for any purpose. Please print a copy of this Privacy Policy for your records.</p>
              
              <li><u>Modifications to this Privacy Policy</u></li>

The revised Privacy Policy will be effective as of its posting unless otherwise stated.</p>

              <li><u>Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Information</u></li>
              
              <p>We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.

              <p>Either Voya Health or a third-party vendor on behalf of Voya Health may automatically collect information while Visitors browse the Website. We may collect such information by tracking, or asking a third party vendor to track, your click-stream activity when such information is not tied to a user ID through the use of "cookie" technology or by tracking internet protocol (IP) addresses, as explained below.</p>

                  <p>You can request to have your Personal Information deleted and we will ask our Service Providers to do the same. Please note that if we delete your Personal Information, many of our Services will not work the same. For example, you will not have an account (since any prior saved data will be deleted). If you make multiple requests under this section, we recommend sending your deletion request last, as we will not be able to fulfill your other requests once we have deleted your information.</p>
                </li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Exceptions: We may not be able to fulfill your request if we (or our Service Providers) are required to retain your Personal Information for one or more of the following reasons:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Transactional: to receive the Services for which the Personal Information was collected, provide a good or service requested by you, or perform a contract we have with you;</li>

                        <li>Legal: to protect against fraud or illegal activity or to comply with applicable law or a legal obligation, or exercise rights under the law, such as the right to free speech; or</li>
                        <li>Internal Use: to use your Personal Information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided the information (i.e., to improve our services).</li>
                        <li>To exercise your right to deletion, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@voyahealth.com" class="nanotek-link">privacy@voyahealth.com</a> and follow these instructions:</li>

              <p>Please include sufficient Personal Information for us to verify the identity affiliated with your account. For example, provide your full name, address, Email, Phone Number, and account number if applicable. We may request additional information to complete the verification process if we cannot verify your identity initially. Our ability to fulfill your deletion request is limited by the information you provide us, and the information associated with your account. For example, if you have multiple email addresses and you include only one in your request, we will only delete the email address that you included in the request. To delete multiple email addresses, you must verify you own applicable email account by sending the request from the applicable email address.</p>
