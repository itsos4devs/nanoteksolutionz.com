            <p><b>Telehealth and Telemedicine Services</b></p>
            <p>By accessing this  part of the  Site, you are  accessing medical services which will  be  provided via audio, video or live chat capabilities remotely or in your residence (the “<u>Medical Services</u>”) by a licensed health care practitioner (the “<u>Provider</u>”) employed by, and/or under contract with, Voya Health Medical Group, PLLC, a Tennessee professional limited liability company (the “<u>PLLC</u>”) for a telehealth virtual consultation (“Telehealth Visits”).</p>

            <p>These  Terms  of  Service(“<u>TOS</u>”) are an agreement between you and the PLLC concerning your Telehealth Visits. You accept and agree to be bound by these TOS as well as the <a href="#">Voya Health Terms</a> of Use and the <a href="./privacy-policy.html"><u>Privacy  Policy</u></a>, the  terms  and  conditions  of  which  are  hereby incorporated  by  reference (collectively, the “<u>Terms and Conditions</u>”). If you do not agree to  all of these Terms and  Conditions,  do not access Telehealth Visits.</p>

            <p>In connection with accessing the Medical Services and Telehealth Visits, you acknowledge, understand, consent and agree to the following:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Telehealth Visits  involve the  use  of  electronic  communications  to  enable the  Providers at different locations to share individual patient medical information for the purpose of providing the Medical Services and improving patient care.</li>
              <li>A Telehealth  Visit is  not  the  same  as  an  in-person direct  patient/healthcare  provider  visit, because you will not be in the same room as the Provider providing the Medical Services.</li>
              <li>
                You understand  that  parts  of  your care  and  treatment that require  physical  tests  or examinations may be conducted by providers other than the Provider.
              </li>
              <li>
                The communications systems used during the Telehealth  Visits  will  incorporate  reasonable security protocols to protect the confidentiality of  patient information and will include reasonable measures to safeguard the  data and to ensure its integrity against intentional or unintentional corruption. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Nevertheless, you understand that there are potential risks to the use of this technology during the Telehealth Visits, including but not limited to: 
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>Delays in medical evaluation and consultation or treatment may occur due to deficiencies or failures of the equipment or network interruption</li>
                  <li>Security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal health information</li>
                  <li>Lack of access to complete medical records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other negative outcomes; and</li>
                  <li>Interruptions, unauthorized access by third parties, and technical difficulties.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                You  are aware  that  either  the  Provider or  you can  discontinue  the  Telehealth  Visit  if  we believe that the video conferencing connections are not adequate for the situation.
              </li>
              <li>
                You understand that the Telehealth Visit will not be audio or video recorded at any time, and you agree not to audio or video record the Telehealth Visit.
              </li>
              <li>
                In  connection  with  a  Telehealth  Visit, you  may  be  requested by  a  Provider to upload,  post, publish  or  display  (hereinafter, “<u>upload”</u>)images, videos, photographs, information,  data, text, messages or other materials (“<u>content</u>”). You will ensure that all content you upload or share with  the  PLLC  and  the  Providers complies  with  all  applicable  laws,  rules  and regulations, is appropriate  and non-offensive,  and that you have all necessary rights to use, share, and/or upload such content, without infringing any third party rights.
              </li>
              <li>
                To  the  extent  applicable,  you  hereby  consent  and  authorize  the  PLLC  and  any  Provider associated  with  the  PLLC  to  review  and  use  content  you  have uploaded  to  the  Site  in connection with the Medical Services provided to you pursuant to any Telehealth Visit.
              </li>
              <li>
                You  agree  that  the  PLLC  may  use  and  disclose  your  Protected  Health  Information  (as  that term  is  define  under  HIPAA)  in  accordance  with  applicable  law  and  the  Notice  of  Privacy Practices provided to you.

               </li>
                  <li>
                    Asking non-medical personnel to leave the room where the Provider is conducting the Telehealth Visit at any time if their presence is not mandated for safety concerns, or
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Termination of the service at any time.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                You agree that you are entering into an agreement with the PLLC which shall be a provider of the Medical Services to you, which means, among other things, you are entering into a practitioner-patient relationship with the health care practitioner associated with the PLLC that personally performs the Medical Services.
              </li>
              <li>
                You understand and agree that Voya Health, Inc.is the provider of certain administrative services to the PLLC and does not provide professional medical services itself.
              </li>
              <li>
                In connection with the Medical Services and the provision of Telehealth Visits, you consent and agree to the release of your medical records which other treating providers may have.

                <u>Prescriptions</u>. With respect to Telehealth Visits, you agree that Providers associated with the PLLC may not prescribe the following drugs:
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>
                    Prescriptions for narcotics or DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) (<a href="http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/" target="_blank">http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/</a>) controlled substances (Schedule I, II, III),
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Prescriptions for medications that are restricted by states.
                  </li>

              </li>
              <li>
                Neither Voya Health, Inc. nor the PLLC is a drug fulfillment warehouse.

            <p>To access Providers for Telehealth Visits, you must first establish an individual user account (“<u>Account</u>”) by providing certain information. You agree that you will not create more than one Account or create an Account for anyone other than yourself.

As such, you may be billed more than once with respect to a Telehealth Visit to account for additional co-pay, co-insurance and deductible amounts due, if any. Should you choose not to enter your health plan billing details, you elect to be seen as self-pay, thereby waiving health plan claim submission.</p>

            <p>You agree that the PLLC is authorized to charge to the Payment Method a fee in the event that either you (i) miss a scheduled appointment with a Provider; or (ii) do not provide the PLLC with at least twenty-four (24)  hour notice of cancellation prior to a scheduled appointment with a Provider.</p>

            <p>You  agree  that  authorizations  to  charge  your Payment  Method  remains  in  effect  until  you  cancel  it  in writing,  and you agree to notify Voya Health,  Inc. of  any changes to your Payment Method.

You acknowledge  that  the  origination  of  ACH  transactions  to  your  account  must  comply  with  applicable provisions of U.S. law. In the case of an ACH transaction rejected for insufficient funds, Voya Health, Inc. may at its discretion attempt to process the charge again at any time within  30  days.
